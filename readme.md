## Overview 
Gluten Free NSW is a iPhone application [released in 2009] which lists gluten free friendly restaurants and cafe's within New South Wales (inc. ACT).

The application allows you to easily find restaurants closest to you or in a particular suburb. There are currently over 1000 restaurant listings which can be viewed in a list or on a map, and are easily searched upon and sorted.

The database is not stored in this git repository. There is a SQLite database which contains the data structure but with no data. (glutenfreensw_datastructureonly.sqlite)

Note: I have pulled this app from the Apple App Store around 2013 as there are now many more suitable apps for this purpose. When I first created the app it was alot harder to find gluten free restaurants than it is now.
